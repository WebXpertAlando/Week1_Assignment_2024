The first notebook contains Part 1 of the Assignment where I've used python codes to perform certain operations based on the criteria we were given using weather dataset.

# Week1_Assignment_2024 Part 2
The second notebook  reguired us to connect to any RDMS like Mysql, Postgres to notebook and perform necessary SQL expressions and finally use any db tool or commands to move the csv file to any database of choice. 

For my case I used dbeaver Community Edition to import the csv weather dataset to Postgresql.
